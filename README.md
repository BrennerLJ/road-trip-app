# Road Tripper

This is a helpful guide to planning any road trip!

## Description

This website shows resources that can help you plan your road trip. There are 2 main features on our website. The first is a way to check road conditions in several different Utah cities. There are images that update every 2 minutes and they show you what the traffic and road conditions are like. The second feature is a gas price checker. You can search for any city and you will be given the average gas price in that city. These two main features will help you map out your road trip and plan your stops efficiently.
